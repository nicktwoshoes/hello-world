# hello-world

Here I go.

I don't really know what I'm doing right now, but I signed up for GitHub because I noticed that everyone seems to use it and it appears to be a good place to practice coding.

I'm early on in my web development journey and still trying to figure out which path I want to follow, but for now, I'm really enjoying delving into CSS.
